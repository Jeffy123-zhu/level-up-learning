### Hello and Welcome to My Project!

This is a super cool online quiz application called LevelUp Learning!

Studying formulas or historical dates can be boring, right? I created this platform because I wanted to turn practicing questions into a level-up adventure! It's a single-page application (SPA)—you just open it and play, no downloads or installations needed.

### Core Gameplay and Goals

Challenge Quests: Choose a subject (like Math or Science), just like picking different maps in a game.

Level Up: Earn experience (XP) and see your level increase with every correct answer. It’s super satisfying to watch that progress bar fill up!

Instant Feedback: You immediately know if your answer is right or wrong, which makes learning super efficient.

Fully Responsive: Whether you're on a phone, an iPad, or a desktop computer, the interface looks and works perfectly!

Action Required! Please upload your project screenshot (e.g., dashboard.png) to the assets folder in your GitHub repository to ensure the image displays below.

### Project Tech Stack Deep Dive

Don't let the single index.html file fool you—it holds a lot of power!

HTML: Responsible for the core structure.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): I avoided complex frameworks. All the logic (scoring, question rotation, correctness checks) is built using pure, native JavaScript. This is the hardcore way!

Tailwind CSS: I used this tool to make the interface look modern and responsive quickly, ensuring the app looks great on any screen size.
