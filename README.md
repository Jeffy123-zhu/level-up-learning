### LevelUp Learning: My Gamified Study Challenge!

### Hello and Welcome to My Project!

This is a super cool online quiz application called LevelUp Learning!

Studying formulas or historical dates can be boring, right? I created this platform because I wanted to turn practicing questions into a level-up adventure! It's a single-page application (SPA)—you just open it and play, no downloads or installations needed.

### Core Gameplay and Goals

Challenge Quests: Choose a subject (like Math or Science), just like picking different maps in a game.

Level Up: Earn experience (XP) and see your level increase with every correct answer. It’s super satisfying to watch that progress bar fill up!

Instant Feedback: You immediately know if your answer is right or wrong, which makes learning super efficient.

Fully Responsive: Whether you're on a phone, an iPad, or a desktop computer, the interface looks and works perfectly!

### Project Tech Stack Deep Dive

Don't let the single index.html file fool you—it holds a lot of power!

HTML: Responsible for the core structure.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): I avoided complex frameworks. All the logic (scoring, question rotation, correctness checks) is built using pure, native JavaScript. This is the hardcore way!

Tailwind CSS: I used this tool to make the interface look modern and responsive quickly, ensuring the app looks great on any screen size.
